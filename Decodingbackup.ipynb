    "For this project, I focus on decoding head-orientations within the static conditions. These analyses will be used to assess the baseline capacities of a decoding model trained on static trials, which will be essential for evaluating the success of the models that we eventually use to cross-decode head-orientation in the dynamic trials. \n",

    "Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants n=20 viewed a total of 16 stimuli of static head-orientations in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion over time. MEG was used to record neural data from 269 sensors as they viewed the stimuli. Each stimulus appeared for a total of 300 miliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MEG data has been minimally preprocessed and epoched in a -.2 to .6 second window around stimulus onset. Next, I trained a linear discriminant classifier to decode head-orientation across all 16 conditions."

    "The above plot shows decoding over time with a secondary plot showing the results of the BayesFactor test. The purpose of this test is to compare two hypotheses: the null hypothesis (N1), defined as mean decoding accuracy being at chance, and the alternative hypothesis (A1), on which mean decoding accuracy is above chance. The test is one-tailed, as we always expect only at chance or above chance decoding. The BF quantifies how likely we are to observe the data at a timepoint given N1 and A1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also defined a band where the evidence was 'inconclusive', from a BF of 1/6 to 6, shown in grey above. We picked this as 1/6 is typically considered the threshold for strong evidence for the null, and 6 is typically considered the threshold for strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis. Effect size is set using the nullinterval in a BF test, and previous simulations from our lab have suggested that .5 is typically the best threshold to set for effect size in MEG experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we can see that prior to the presentation of a stimulus, we find strong evidence for the null hypothesis. This result is expected, because the model should be at chance before any stimulus was on the screen. Once the stimulus is presented, the neural latency (the first of five timepoints in a row where we have more than moderate evidence for A1) is 89.2ms. This suggests an estimate for the amount of time it takes before information about face-orientation has had time to process through the visual system in a way detectable by MEG sensors. Evidence for A1 stays about the inconclusive band all the way until .6 seconds, which is .3 seconds after stimulus onset. Therefore, substantial information about head-orientation remains in someone's visual system at least 300ms after the offset of such a stimulus."
